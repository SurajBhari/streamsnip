The primary goal of streamsnip is to streamline the clipping process, addressing challenges faced by one of my favorite streamers. Here's how you can make the most of it:
## Monetization
This program WAS free. now it requires a membership to use. although you can try this for free for 28 days. </br>
You can also donate if you like the code or the service. </br>
<a href="https://surajbhari.stck.me" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" style="height: 41px !important;width: 174px !important;box-shadow: 0px 3px 2px 0px rgba(190, 190, 190, 0.5) !important;-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 3px 2px 0px rgba(190, 190, 190, 0.5) !important;" ></a> </br>
Earnings goes back to development and hosting costing. 
## Nightbot Command:

```markdown
!addcom !clip $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/$(querystring)?delay=-40)
```
Just adding this command will get you started. but if you want to have a discord message. or customization then read below. </br>
this is the most famous way of using it. Simply copy paste this in your chat. 

## Nightbot panel way
Go to [Nightbot Dashboard](https://nightbot.tv/commands/custom) and add command like this <br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bcd6f18-4da2-492b-8286-478d0b46438c)


If you want to send a discord message. then I would need to add a webhook URL alongside the youtube channel ID. ~~for that fill [this form](https://forms.gle/NgF67HBR69CxAcvJ8) or contact me here.~~ Head over to https://streamsnip.com/settings and add webhook url there.<br>
| Contact | Discord |
|---|---|
| ![Discord Badge](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/shield/408994955147870208) | [![Server Badge](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/2XVBWK99Vy)](https://discord.gg/2XVBWK99Vy) |

## Optional Arguments:
## This is one way to add arguments. if you want a simpler way head over at https://streamsnip.com/settings page.

This override the default settings. so if you have multiple instance of command and you don't want a particular instance to follow the /settings. you use this.
- `showlink` (default: true) - Display the link where all clips can be viewed.
- `screenshot` (default: false) - Enable or disable screenshot capture. If enabled the nightbot may not get response in given time and will say "Timed out" message. but it will still clip.
- `delay` (default: 0) - Introduce an artificial delay to the command. Useful for scheduling links in the future or past.
- `force_desc` (default: false) - if set to true will deny any clip that doesn't have a title (description as its called in backend). please ensure that your viewers know this is the case. else you will miss out on a lot of clips <br>

- `silent` (default: 2||Highest) - Level of the clipping message. see example below. </br>
  ![image](https://github.com/SurajBhari/streamsnip/assets/45149585/f4e0bffa-1759-491a-ada9-c1ca4a55240b)
- `private` (default: false) - If set to true. the clips made are not shown on the web nor impact stats. if you don't want your channel to show up on website. you use it. This override `silent` and returns just ​​`clipped 😉` </br>
  ![image](https://github.com/SurajBhari/streamsnip/assets/45149585/42c6744e-f3d1-4335-822c-3c3713ac4ab4)
- `webhook` (default: None) - You can provide your own webhook URL instead of the one provided earlier (if you did). By combining this with `private`, you can create completely anonymous clips in a private channel.
  
To use your webhook URL, it should be in the format of webhook_id/webhook_token. For example, if your webhook URL is:
```
https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1211440693168447599/ieU15QcFI_PcAun88TFGpUuRMK6E7Me14jioxB1mbJrRU6ay3XI8jByeEk3XKlVKr8_s
```
You would pass `webhook=1211440693168447599/ieU15QcFI_PcAun88TFGpUuRMK6E7Me14jioxB1mbJrRU6ay3XI8jByeEk3XKlVKr8_s` as the argument. 
- `message_level` (default: 0) - Customize how the discord message should look like. to support "anonymity"
  ![image](https://github.com/SurajBhari/streamsnip/assets/45149585/bf5e5ced-0472-4a5a-9a84-9b03f4364596)
- `take_delays` (default: false) - Do you consider your viewers to be smarter than average person ? if you turn this on. the first and last `word` will be evaluted to add/subtract delay.
  The following screenshot was taken with delay=0. but it still gave a delay of `20 seconds` as the author wrote `-20` as first word. <br>
  Remember. this doesn't Override the delay parameter. it only add the delay. so if you had -40 in `delay` arg. then delay in the below example would be -60. and not -40.

<details>
  <summary>Click me to open advanced options.</summary>
  
  Idea from [here](https://community.nightdev.com/t/clip-command-then-have-lastclip-automatically-update/35360), You can combine !search command to give out timestamp to particular events in the stream </br>
  A combo can look like this 
  ```
  !addcom !clipkill $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/kill-automated)
  !addcom !lastkill $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/search/kill-automated)
  ```
  Want more advanced ? here </br>
  There is one more endpoint named `/searchx/<clip-desc>` that returns JSON of the clip with that clip-desc.</br>
  THIS IS JUST 1 EXAMPLE. SKY IS THE LIMIT HERE
  ```
  !addcom !lastkilltime $(eval clip=$(urlfetch json https://streamsnip.com/searchx/kill-automated); clip['hms'])
  ```
  returning data looks something like this </br>
  ![carbon (3)](https://github.com/SurajBhari/streamsnip/assets/45149585/f7709890-6959-4a25-8a6d-292c9d20e10b)
  
     
  8. `!streaminfo`  this gives streaminfo in JSON format that you can use to do some other stuff.
     data looks something like this.
     ![carbon](https://github.com/SurajBhari/streamsnip/assets/45149585/811ec86a-9d69-4cc3-bde5-2d2cc66bd5ac)
     
     Route is at `/stream_info`
     ```markdown
     !addcom !myid $(eval info=$(urlfetch json https://streamsnip.com/stream_info); info['author_id'])
     ```

## Self Hosting 
<details>
  I made it quite easy to host yourself. if you prefer that way.
  
  ### Installation
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Install requirements - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. (Optional) Install ffmpeg and ytdlp for screenshot to work.
  4. CONFIG - edit config.sample.json to config.json and insert few keys in it. `password` to use at `/admin` page and `/add` route.

  ### Running
  1. Run by doing. `python main.py`
  2. (Optional) You can run. `helper/maintainer.py`. for this you will need `management_webhook` in config.json to send you backup and logs to your discord.
  3. For nightbot. you need to replace `streamsnip.com` to your ip. and use `http` instead of `https`. 
</details>

### Additional Customization:

1. You can use `-ul=userlevel` to limit clipping to specific user levels (e.g., mods). Find user levels [here](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/commands#advanced-usage) to reduce spam and grant clipping access to specific individuals.  </br>

2. You can add a timer from [here](https://nightbot.tv/timers). to remind users to clip moments regularly <br> Ex. <br> 
```
​Saw something amazing ⭐? Type !clip to clip it and ship it 📩to Discord. (Also add a useful title too after the command (Optional but Preferred))
```
